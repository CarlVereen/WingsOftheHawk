          It is now day three and I have learned some CSS and more HTML. I have also learned how to use some CSS frameworks. And have started to change my site to reflect what I have learned. Click on Day 1 to see the first site. Then you will see that on this page I have added columns, and margins and all kinds of stuff using bootstrap. Next step organizing a better layout for my blog.

          Welcome to my blog on my career change. As you can see there is not much here. And that is where we begin. As it stands right now I don't have much to start with, nor do I have many skills. And this white page with paragraphs, lists and heading is to show that.

          I am changing careers for many reasons, which I will share as we go. Like many individuals out there this is a daunting task. So to help you and me I will write about my journey from the perverbal day one. And as an outline I will be following an article written by Code Conquest, called <a href="">How to become a coder in 6 months: a Step-by-Step Action Plan"</a>. I will be adding a soft skills portion to the plan as well. As I believe that both coding skills and soft skills will be necessary for my future success.
